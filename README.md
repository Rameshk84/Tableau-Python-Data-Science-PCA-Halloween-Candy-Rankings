## Goal

## Use data to find the three types of Halloween candy that will make you the most popular house on the block

## Approach
* View the data in Python
* Apply PCA to the data to create a scatter plot in Python
* Identify clusters and filter the data down to three candies in Tableau
## My Top Picks
1. A popular candy: Reese's Peanut Butter Cup
2. A popular chocolate option: Twix
3. A popular fruity option: Starburst
